## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

While working on this project, I found out that `display:flex` is a one dimensional layout, which means that you can layout items in a row or column. Whereas `display:grid` is best for two dimensional layouts, which means that you can layout items in both rows and columns. (`display: flex` can be seen with the mobile design, and `display: grid` can be seen with the desktop design. )

### Useful resources
